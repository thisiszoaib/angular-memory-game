# Memory Card Game with Angular 10

This is a demo project showcasing a memory card game I used to play as a kid (with real cards of course!). It is built in Angular 10, with Angular Material for the buttons, Angular Animations for the card flip effects and images from Unsplash API.

Will be posting a blog post covering the code in a few days.

Cheers :)
